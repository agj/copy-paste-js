Copy&Paste JS
=============

A collection of javascript utilities designed for copy & pasting into your project, for when it's impractical or undesirable to depend on external modules. Most of these are compact yet readable one-liners. The design of these utilities focuses on function composition. All are properly spec-tested, and released into the public domain (see bottom of this file).


## The utilities

<!-- CONDITION: esVersion === 6 -->
The following adhere to the ES2015 standard, to use in modern browsers or up-to-date versions of Node. For ES5 (backward-compatible) utilities, [see the `es5.md` file.](es5.md)
<!-- END CONDITION -->
<!-- CONDITION: esVersion === 5 -->
The following adhere to the ES5 standard, for compatibility with environments that might not be up-to-date. For ES2015 utilities, [see the `README.md` file.](README.md)
<!-- END CONDITION -->

I apologize for the fact that there is currently no documentation for these utilities. For now you may check the specs in the `src/utilities/[group]/[utility]/test.js` files to see how they are used.
