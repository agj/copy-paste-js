# Copy&Paste JS ðŸ“‹

A collection of small, stand-alone JavaScript (and TypeScript) utilities designed for copy-pasting into your project, for whenever it's impractical or undesirable to depend on external utility libraries such as [Ramda][ramda] or [Lodash][lodash]. A good use case is [userscripts][userscripts]! The design of these utilities is focused on function compositionâ€”many functions return other functions that take more arguments. All of the code is released onto the public domain.

This is still a work in (slow) progress. Some caveats:

- Not every utility has a proper explanation of what it does, and no examples of use are provided.
- The TypeScript versions don't all have type declarations yet.
- Although there's unit tests for every utility, most still require improvements.
