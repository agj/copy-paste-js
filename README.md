# Copy&Paste JS

A collection of small JavaScript (and TypeScript) utilities designed for copy-and-pasting into your project, for whenever it's impractical or undesirable to depend on external libraries. The design of these utilities focuses on function composition. They are all unit-tested, and released onto the public domain.
