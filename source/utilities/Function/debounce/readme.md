Takes a delay in seconds `secs` and a function `fn`, and returns a function that calls `fn` only after `secs` have passed without having been invoked. Useful, for instance, to make sure repeated changes executed in a small space of time don't cause too many expensive computations, and only when done perform a calculation.
